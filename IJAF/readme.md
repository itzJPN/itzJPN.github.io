# IJAF: ItzJPN & JBlueBird app files

This directory (itzJPN.github.io/IJAIF) contains the files needed by my Apps (iCopy updates, app installation, etc). It is the new directory replacing jbluebird.github.io/h, and the full replace will go into effect for all apps by November 20th, 2025. 

The old directory will still exist, but it's only containing the latest upgrade files for older existing copys of apps.
