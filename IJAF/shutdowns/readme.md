# Shutdowns
In extra protection that some of my personal scripts go rouge, I always include code to check if it should run. That way, in case one does go rouge, I can change a .txt file on my server to stop it. This is really useful for personal and public projects, and this folder contains those txt files.

Need to shutdown an app from the public eye? Change the txt file! You get the jist.
